# example-loopback-secure-storage

The project is generated by [LoopBack](http://loopback.io).

It is basically a demo for the [loopback-secure-storage](https://github.com/rascafr/loopback-secure-storage) component developped by the same author.

## Instructions

Just clone the repository, then run `npm i` inside and you're done.

Start the project with `npm start`, the API explorer webpage will open directly.

**Note:** The swagger is started at server initialisation for documentation purpose, but you might want to use Postman instead for instance (mostly for `createFile` and `downloadFile`), or even Curl! ðŸ˜Ž

```bash
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:3000/api/SecretDocuments/1234/downloadFile' > test.pdf
```

## Project's API

The example shows a container to store PDF in a secure way, using the *SecureStorage* component with AES-128 encryption.

**Available routes:**

- `/api/SecretDocuments`: will return the list of the stored documents

- `/api/SecretDocuments/createFile` will attempt to upload the given file and store it as a encrypted file using the `storage.json` config file

- `/api/SecretDocuments/{documentId}/downloadFile`: will try to download the given document

- `/api/SecretDocuments/{documentId}/deleteFile`: will try to delete the stored document and it database entry

## I want it!

Great! Then feel free to run `npm i loopback-secure-storage` in your own project and you're good to go.
